                        <b>No Racial Slurs</b>
                        <p>
                            No racial slurs, please. We have already blacklisted one and if use any loopholes or so, you will be banned. Any slur such as "Ching Chong" or the "N-Word" will not be tolerated here either, even if it's fine by anyone, as we do not want a toxic, degenerated community
                        </p>

                        <b>Please Keep This Server Civilized</b>
                        <p>
                            As stated before, we do not want this server to become toxic or a degenerate arcadia/meme paradise. We want to hold a proper image with disciplined and mature members. Because of so, please:
                            <table style="width: 100%">
                                <tr>
                                    <td>
                                        <p>
                                            1. DO NOT casually break atleast ONE RULE. It will go out of hand if you do so, and we do not want to be like many other discord servers. We want to be somewhere near like "The Joy of Mapping"
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                    <td>
                                        <p>
                                            2. Post anything NSFW-related. We do not have a dedicated channel for that, however, you ARE allowed to talk about anime and post images of so, as long as they are not NSFW. And please do not call anyone weeb or so. Keep <i><u>ALL THAT HENTAI CRAP OUT OF HERE</u></i>.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>
                                        <p>
                                            3. Post "sauce". Seriously, we do not want our server flooded with random 6-digit codes. And it ties with the second sub-rule of Rule 2. <i><u>KEEP ALL THAT HENTAI CRAP OUT OF HERE</u></i>
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                    <td>
                                        <p>
                                            4. Do not call people anything deflamatory. Like stated before don't call someone a weeb, even if they saw a millisecond worth of anime. It's just stupid.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>
                                        <p>
                                           5. Flood the place. Even if we have a memes channel (which we will not), it is strictly controlled, and we do not want any topics of anime hitler, history memes, "hornybaiting", etc. 
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                    <td>
                                        <p>
                                           6. Don't turn this place into "Degenerate Arcadia". It ties with all above sub rules. We want this place clean and disciplined.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>
                                        <p>
                                           7. Discuss politics. Yes, we can agree or disagree on things, but please don't discuss any politics. We don't care if you're conservative or not, politics always give off a bad aura around everyone. You are allowed to say that you are "Chicken Wing" however.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>

                                        <p>
                                           8. No religious talks, please. It's okay to recite any religious text, as long as if you're not trying to spark a religious conversation.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>

                        <p>
                            We do not want anyone to misclick on any site that we cannot describe, or could damage a person's computer. Do not upload suspicious files either. Non-suspicious links or files such Doom wads are okay, as long as they aren't terrywads or joke wads, or a link to a youtube video.

                        <p>
                            You can do anything you want if you're alone, but please, don't join voice conversations just to play the sounds of an angry Mexican family or a general nuisance. And please do not blast earrape or loud music with anyone around. In addition, please do not skip any songs you don't like.
                        </p>

                            By that, please do not ask an underage girl (or a catfisher) for her phone number, lewd pictures, etc. Asking for lewd pictures of a potential minor is illegal and we do not want to deal with that.

	                    <b>Don't Skip a Song You Don't Like</b>
	                    <p>
                            Like in the general rules. Don't skip a song because you hate it. The only exception to that is Nazi music. No, just no. Nobody wants to hear that. Horst-Wessel-Lied is also an exception, even Bobby Prince's cover. We don't want terrible things to happen to our German/Austrian members. If the song is "The Nazi Rap", then it's fine. It's a Bobby Prince song with no lyrics.

	                    <p>
                            Same goes for administrators (Agent Smith) and US Border Patrol. Just because you have those ranks doesn't mean you can flood the place with NSFW images or break any rule. You can also not be a de facto leader and lift any rule. Any rule applied will always stay in place.
