            <h1>Holy! You're making a game?</h1>
            <p>No, it's just me planning it out. If you steal my idea's I will hunt you down, and I you'll meet either Jesus or Satan.</p>
            <h2>What are you making?</h2>
            <p>
                This is all I could make. It's all coded in HTML with a tiny amount of JavaScript, no PHP. I don't worship Satan. God, I still hate what that language did to me... <br>
                I'm making a game. So basically here's the game summarized: You're one of the god-knows-how-many people immune to the virus, in a world struck by an epidemic, and <br> 
                along came zombies. The game is set around 2012, with the mechanics of survival and crafting, but also weight, in order for a more realistic approach. The game might <br>
                also possibly be loosely based off of Contagion, and also Train to Busan, No More Room in Hell, and a few Roblox games.
            </p>

            <h1>When will development start?</h1>
                <p>
                    We may never know. Currently I'm dealing with real-life problems, and also how I'm probably going to make one large game entirely alone. But as of now I'm already <br>
                    doing a bit of some artwork that can be found within the game (Logos, they could be found on billboards and stores, and so.)
