                Introducing, the "YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE" license, a custom made public license. What? We could've been nicer? Oh well, who cares? It's a license still. YAI or YAB <br>
                if you want to be nicer then.
            </p>
            <p>
                YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE. A public license that I created, and will license some works I make (if I have any) with this. You are free to use this license if you want. <br>
                Just select which variant you want to use and include the document with the works. All elements inspired by other licenses, mainly the "Don't be a Dick" license <br>
                Any translations would be greatly appreciated. More variants of the license will be coming soon.
            </p>
            <h1><i>YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE, IF... Public License</i></h1>

                YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE PUBLIC LICENSE <br>
                "YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE" Is a license granting anyone freely to distribute mainly software, but also any other form of media such as artwork, music, or videos <br>
                under the terms that: <br>
                <h2>YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE IF YOU: </h2>
                    <h3>1. COMMERCIALLY DISTRIBUTE THE SOURCE CODE</h3>
                        <p>You're really an asshole if you do that, so don't consider doing so!</p>
                    <h3>2. CLAIM ANY WORK AS YOUR OWN</h3>
                        <p>That includes modifiying even the slightest thing, or just flat-out claiming that it's yours. Do we have to say more? </p>
                    <h3>3. USE IT FOR POTENTIALLY "INAPPROPRIATE" OR "HARMFUL" CONTENT</h3>
                        <p>We don't want to go over that, or have that. Infact nobody does.</p>
                    <h3>4. COPYRIGHTING THE WORK AS YOURS</h3>
                        <p>You're really an asshole if you do this. PEOPLE WORKED HARD ON THOSE THINGS (or not), YET YOU JUST FLATOUT COPYRIGHT THE <br>
                        WORK AS <u>YOURS</u>. If you want to be that guy just read Proverbs 6:16-19 of King James Version, then suffer in the fiery <br> depths of HELL.</p>
                <h2>YOU'RE NOT AN ASSHOLE IF YOU:</h2>
                    <h3>1. Take inspiration from something</h3>
                        <p>Inspiration is tolerated. It's okay to take a few elements of a certain work, however taking too much is considered plagiarism.</p>
                    <h3>2. Credit the ORIGINAL owner</h3>
                        <p>Always credit the correct person. Unless you couldn't find the original source, DO NOT USE THAT WORK. If everyone was permitted <br>
                        to use something, then it shall be considered Public Domain. </p>
                    <h3>3. Don't claim something as yours</h3>
                        <p>This happens alot with many people's works, due to a thing called "Plagiarism". If you don't use any work that's not yours <br>
                        claiming it is yours, you're not an asshole</p>
                    <h3>4. Don't use copyrighted materials alongsided work under this license</h3>
                        <p>Taking any material licensed under the YAI license and collaging it with other copyrighted works is a bad thing to do. DON'T DO IT.</p>
