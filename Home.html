            <!--Copy above here-->
            <p>
                This is all I could make. It's all coded in HTML with a tiny amount of JavaScript, no PHP. I don't worship Satan. God, I still hate what that language did to me... <br>
                it's cursed, unholy... of course developers hate it, they know it's not Christian but rather the work of the devil himself. How can we ever bring eternal damnation <br>
                to such evil? And people that make anything in PHP like Wiki Software (MediaWiki, PmWiki, etc) have to be sinners. The 8th deadly sin must be using the PHP coding  <br>
                language. I have a <a href="PHPTests/iHate.php">sub-site</a> dedicated to this subject here. Oh, it's ironically written in PHP. Guess I'm a sinner now. Of course, it's open source. This is github <br>
                sites. Well anyways. Also of course it's unfinished. I just need to learn how to make the background of this longer without also moving the text down. Damn you PHP... <br>
            </p>
            <h2>How is this site unfinished?</h2>
            <p>
                How do you not know? Look around. Sure, I am going to remove this part and all when I finish it (I probably won't), but this site is under a lot of construction. And I <br>
                also need a better background for this site than the Nagoya skyline which looks like it was put through an Anime-ifying GAN, because if you look down, oh look! It's like <br>
                what happens in Tiny Tower when you scroll down too far. If you managed to see it, you know what I mean, but if you don't, here's what I mean: If you scroll then, there's <br>
                the skyline of the city behind your tower, or the background. Scrolling down shows the background but without your tower in the way.
            </p>
            <h2>More questions you'll probably ask</h2>
            <p><i>That I probably won't answer</i></p>
                <h3>Why is there no sidebar?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because, I'm not that much experienced in HTML, and the sidebar part is living hell. The "ABitModern" skin on PmWiki makes it look easy... curse them...
                    </p>
                <h3>Why is there no search?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I said the site was unfinished you stooge. Plus I don't think Github would allow that
                    </p>
                <h3>How do you create new pages without PHP?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I don't worship the devil. I create them by copying and pasting the code, editing things up, and voila. 
                    </p>
                <h3>What's with the footer?</h3>
                    <p>For the love of god, for the last time</p>
            <h2>Questions for real</h2>
            <p>Submit them <a href="https://forms.gle/j16iVgFxENewR3Sh8" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            <p>I currently have no questions</p>
